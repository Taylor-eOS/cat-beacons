This project envisions a BLE cat-positioning network where a featherweight collar transmitter on the animal broadcasts low-energy radio pulses to fixed yard receivers, enabling rough zonal awareness like "near the tool shed" without the bulk or drain of onboard GPS, calculated instead by overlaps in detection signals that a central device fuses into a position with a simple likelihood model. The collar centers on a single-chip BLE module such as the DA14531, strapped to a breakaway clasp with a small battery, its firmware a bare loop of advertising a unique identifier. Four to eight ESP32 or nRF52 nodes perched on solar-recharged stakes or plugged into outdoor sockets around the farm's perimeter passively scan for that ID, logging received signal strength indicators every cycle and forwarding them. A Python daemon feed incoming RSSI tuples to a Gaussian process estimator. For each possible yard grid point, compute expected strengths from receiver positions assuming inverse-square decay, then score likelihood as the exponential of negative squared errors divided by noise variance, peaking the probability mass into zones with confidence thresholds to trigger notifications. Calibration happens interactively: walk the yard with a mock collar, tweaking decay constants, or using ML to train predictions.
